			<h2>Tips </h2>
			<p> Following I would give you some tips, about Porto. Which should improve your stay in there.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="traveltips">
			<h4>When to Visit?</h4>
			<p><span class="bold">Porto</span> is a city to be enjoyed with sunny weather.
			So the best time to visit the city is anywhere between March and October.
			As during peak winter months the temperatures are cold, and the days tend
			to be very dark and gloomy</p>
			
			<h4>Where to stay?</h4>
			<p><span class="bold">Aliados and Trindade</span> might not be the prettiest,
			but they are public trasnport hubs and have great places to eat and shop nearby.
			I would avoid Fontainhas and Heroismo because og its historic 
			of being a problematic neighborhood. Ribeira and Rua das Flores areas are both 
			beautiful palces to stay, but they are now on a very tourist place,
			therefore it might come as an extra expense.</p>
			
			<h4>What to Eat?</h4>
			<p><span class="bold">Francesinhas</span> This massive sandwich on a platter
			has all the goods on it: cured meat, linguiça, steak, cheese, 
			egg and a delicious beer and tomato sauce.
			My suggestion, have it at lunch rather than at the evening, as you will need
			to burn its calories off.</p>
			
			<h4>How to get around?</h4>
			<p><span class="bold">Walk.</span> Bring some comfortable trainers,
			as you will be hitting your ten thousand steps everyday,
			to burn that lunchtime Francesinha.
			Porto is a quite hilly city, but small in size so almost all 
			the major sights are within reach. Much of the magic and charm of Porto stems
			from walking around. Porto is full of hidden gems that will surprise you
			at every turn.</p>
			
			<h4>São João</h4>
			<p><span class="bold">São João Festival</span> happens every 
			year in the night of the 23rd to 24th of June. 
			The whole city goes out and it is guarranteed partying and dancing all night.
			You should have a local dinner, in one of the improvised street restaurant 
			and enjoy some delicious grilled sardines. One of the major attractions will be 
			the huge fireworks show in Ribeira at midnight, make sure you do not miss it.
			It is also tradition to hit each others' heads with plastic hammers, 
			expect to hit and get hit of course. Light up a paper lantern and make a wish.</p>
