			<p>I am absolutely in love with this city.</p> 
			<p>For its narrow streets and colorful houses,
			breathtaking views from both the city and the Douro river, 
			its galleries full of ancient and contemporary art,
			its gardens and museums, and its restaurants with both traditional food 
			(don't miss the francesinhas and the cachorrinhos) and inspirations 
			from around the world. </p>

				<p>We decided to make a trip to Porto.</p>
				<p>There is so much to do and see around the city and surrounding areas.</p>
				<p>You must take a mini-douro boat cruise. See the bridges and take in the sites of the water front. 
				You will also find very decent linens priced affordably for souveniors.</p>
				<p>Around the city of Porto there are many destinations. 
				Don't be afraid to book a tour and do visit a port winery operation which is usually put together with the mini boat tour. 
				We lucked out visiting the Ferreira Port Wine company and had a complimentary wine tasting.. awesome! 
				We learned a lot about how port is created and will definitly consider a tour of the Douro itself.</p> 
				<p>Loved the city. We'll be back to Porto, and to Portugal soon!</p>

				<p>As a young couple, four days in Porto was the perfect city break.</p>
				<p>Plenty of opportuity to relax along the 'Ribeira' (the riverside) or in the plentiful port lodges.</p> 
				<p>We agreed that Porto is a fabulous and very varied city that can easily meet the needs for most visitors.</p>
				<p>Porto is a city where you can be as busy sightseeing or chilled out as you want. 
				We took it slowly and used the two day ticket on the hop-on hop-off buses to see most of the sights.</p>
				<p>Went on a one hour river cruise on the Douro, visited the beach and spent time enjoying the local wine, port and beer at the numerous Cafes, 
				Port wine cellars and fine restaurants. <p>
				<p>Overall, Porto is an excellent city to visit, spend time in and enjoy.</p>
